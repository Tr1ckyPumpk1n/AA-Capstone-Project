# Capstone Project - Code Crafters

### Description

This is my project "Code Crafters" which is built as an assignment created in 1 day for App Academy's "Building your first website" module. In the assignment we have to build a website on a topic of our own choice where we needed to fulfill the given criteria and requirements for a webpage and apply css to make the website look decent. I tried to find and use no-copyright images for the project, but I may have accidentally used copyrighted images since I picked some of them from google images. I also tried to make the website responsive keeping the required criteria in mind.
